Thanks for visiting my website!

I am an atmospheric researcher specializing in extreme weather and climate. My work focuses on climate science and data analysis, using statistical methods and machine learning to study observational, reanalysis, and model data.

I am particularly interested in understanding how extreme weather patterns are evolving in the context of climate change. By analyzing their characteristics, I aim to uncover the physical mechanisms driving severe weather events.

Beyond data analysis, I also contribute to a project collecting hail samples. Through the study of insoluble particles and isotopes in hailstones, investigating potential ice nuclei concentrations in clouds and tracing the formation pathways of hail.

Feel free to connect with me via [email](cpng@uw.edu).
